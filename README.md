To run the app you have to:
1. Run a server
```
cd server
node app.js
```
2. Run a client
```
cd -
cd client
npm run start
```
3. Call me to add your IP-address to my MongoDB cluster's white list.

Now you can:
* play with a server on http://localhost:4000/graphql
* play with a client on http://localhost:3000
